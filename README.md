# Google Drive to Kodi Connection

This guide will help you set up the connection between Google Drive and Kodi using our Next.js application.

## **What's New?**

ðŸš€ **Redis is no longer required!**  
In this updated version of the application, we have simplified deployment by removing the dependency on Redis. You no longer need to configure external caching services or maintain a Redis instance. This change makes it easier than ever to deploy your own instance with minimal configuration.

ðŸ”„ **Updated Environment Variable Names**  
As part of this update, we have also updated the names of some environment variables to streamline the configuration process. Be sure to check the new variable names in the documentation or the `.env.example` file to avoid any issues during deployment.

These changes reduce complexity and improve the overall experience of setting up and using the application.


## Important Notice

### **Redis Requirement Removed in v2**
Starting with **v2**, Redis is no longer required for the application to function. The new version (v2) uses an in-memory cache for temporary data, which simplifies the deployment process. If you're using **v1** and still need Redis, please follow the instructions for that version.

- **v1 (Legacy)**: Redis **is required**. Please follow the instructions below to set up Redis.
- **v2 (Current)**: Redis **is no longer required**. Skip Redis setup in this version.


## Prerequisites

- **Kodi Installed**: Ensure you have Kodi installed on your device.
- **Google Drive Add-on**: The Google Drive add-on must be installed from the Kodi add-on repository.


## Deploy Your Own Instance
